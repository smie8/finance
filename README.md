FINANCE

Web application, where you can create an user, login to your account to buy and sell stocks with virtual money. I took the idea from Harvard University's edX CS50-course's assignment, but wanted to implement it as a Heroku-app, and also do it fully from scratch myself.

FEATURES:
- login system
- lookup stock prices from Tradier API

FUTURE FEATURES:
- buy and sell stocks

TECH STACK:
- Heroku
- PostgreSQL
- Python
- Flask
- HTML & CSS
- Bootstrap
